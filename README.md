:mortar_board:     Palindrome Project

 :computer:     In this project, I developed a Stack class. Secondly, I developed a Java class named Palindrome that in its main method, receives a string as a command-line argument, and then uses a Stack object to check whether the given string is a palindrome or not.

 :globe_with_meridians:     A Palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same backward or forward. The stack is a simple data structure/container which acts as LIFO (the last element in, would be the first element out.)
